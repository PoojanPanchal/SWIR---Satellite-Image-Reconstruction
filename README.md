##### *NM391-ISRO Reconstruction of missing data in Satellite Imagery* : Short Wave Infra-Red(SWIR) detectors used in satellite imaging cameras suffer from dropouts in pixel and line direction in raw data. Develop software to reconstruct missing parts of a satellite image so that observers are unable to identify regions that have undergone reconstruction.

### Satellite Imagery

- Satellite imagery depicts the Earth’s surface at various spectral, temporal, radiometric, and increasingly detailed spatial resolutions, as is determined by each collection system’s sensing device, and the orbital path of its reconnaissance platform.

- Satellite images are one of the most powerful and important tools used by the meteorologist. They are essentially the eyes in the sky. These images reassure forecasters to the behavior of the atmosphere as they give a clear, concise, and accurate representation of how events are unfolding.

- There are three main types of Satellite Imagery used today : 

	* *VISIBLE IMAGERY* : Visible images represent the amount of sunlight being scattered back into space by the clouds, aerosols, atmospheric gases, and the Earth's surface.

	* ***INFRARED IMAGERY : IR or infrared satellite imagery is sort of a temperature map. The weather satellite detects heat energy in the infrared spectrum (infrared energy is invisible to the human eye). Since temperature, in general, decreases with increasing height, high altitudes will appear whiter than low altitudes.***
	
	* *WATER VAPOUR IMAGERY* : Water vapor satellite pictures indicate how much moisture is present in the upper atmosphere (approximately from 15,000 ft to 30,000 ft). The highest humidities will be the whitest areas while dry regions will be dark. Water vapor imagery is useful for indicating where heavy rain is possible.
